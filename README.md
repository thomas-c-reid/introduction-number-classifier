# introduction-number-classifier
I completed this project as part of a module "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" Where I fed a model a picture of a digit and it outputs a classification

The project was completed in R and gave me a good insight into many different machine learning concepts while also creating a useful model


Section 1 
- Create a logistic regression  to predict the probability of belonging to the “math symbol” category of images.
- Use the same model as a classifier to predict whether an item is a math symbol or not. 
- Plot an ROC curve for the classifier


Section 2
- Use a KNN model to classifier using 5 fold cross validation


Section 3
- Perform classification with random forests using 5-fold cross-validation
- refit the model 15 times, to obtain 15 cross-validated accuracy scores
- Using a neural network build the best possible classifier
