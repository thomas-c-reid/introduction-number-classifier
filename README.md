# introduction-number-classifier
I completed this project as part of a module "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" Where I fed a model a picture of a digit and it outputs a classification

The project was completed in R and gave me a good insight into many different machine learning concepts while also creating a useful model
